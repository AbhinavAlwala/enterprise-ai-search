# Project rules

## Scope and priorities

- Implement only the requested milestone. Do not begin the next milestone automatically.
- Prioritize correctness, readability, simplicity, testability, and reproducibility, in that order.
- Prefer simple, explicit code and clear names. Avoid unnecessary classes and abstractions.
- Use Python type hints and small functions when application code is introduced.
- Add dependencies only when required by the current milestone. Use `uv` and `pyproject.toml`; maintain `uv.lock` once generated.
- Do not create empty folders or placeholder modules for future features.
- Use proper logging in application code. Comments should explain why a choice was made.
- Never fabricate metrics, benchmark results, capabilities, or verification results.
- Keep documentation concise. Avoid filler comments and excessive documentation.

## Milestone completion

1. Implement only that milestone.
2. Run relevant tests. Add tests for implemented behavior when appropriate.
3. Run formatting and linting if configured; report checks that could not run.
4. Update the relevant files under `docs/`.
5. Summarize changed files and explain the implementation simply.
6. State limitations honestly and stop at the requested milestone boundary.

## Documentation responsibilities

- `README.md`: concise, professional, recruiter-facing overview and accurate project status.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: current architecture only.
- `docs/DATA_FLOW.md`: data flow through implemented behavior only.
- `docs/CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md`: important files, functions, execution flow, and concepts to understand.
- `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`: choices, rationale, alternatives, and trade-offs.
- `docs/INTERVIEW_PREP.md`: questions and answers grounded only in implemented features.

The implemented scope includes SciFact ingestion/chunking, BM25, exact CPU dense retrieval, embedding caching, document RRF hybrid retrieval, test evaluation, and artifact comparison. Preserve the frozen BM25/dense source, normalization/chunking defaults, and their original result artifacts. Hybrid uses equal-weight document RRF with k=60 and 100 unique candidates per retriever, chosen before evaluation and not tuned on test metrics. Reuse document deduplication, metrics, and the existing embedding cache. Generate comparison values/README tables from executed artifacts. Unit tests must use local fixtures/fake encoders without model downloads or network access. Ignore data, model weights, and binary caches; keep result JSON small. Report setup separately from online latency; hybrid latency includes both retrieval paths and fusion. Do not begin reranking or future features without a requested milestone.
